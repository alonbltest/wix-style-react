# Cheatsheet Contribution

### Symbols & Components Terminology

1. `Symbol` is the visual Sketch representation of the UI Component.
2. `Component` is the actual implementation of the UI element.
3. `Component Story` is the documentation page which explains how to use the component.
4. `UX Story` is the documentation page which reflects the `Symbol` constrains.


### Motivation
* **Components Inventory-** improving the components discoverability.
* **Mapping Symbol to Components-** making sure that we are aligned Symbol <=> Component as much as possible.
* **Source of truth**
* **Bridge the gap between the design and the actual implementation:**
    * Helping the FEDs to understand which components to use based on the UX symbol which is displayed in the Zeplin files.
    * Helping the UX Designers & Product to understand how the components behave and implemented.
