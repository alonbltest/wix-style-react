# Continuous Integration

In general, _Continuous Integration_ is a practice of regularly integrating code changes into a code repository, in a way that these changes trigger a build which asserts that nothing is broken.
This process allows multiple developers to merge their commits into a shared repository.

The next phase, assuming all of the build steps finish successfully, is releasing to production manually. That practice called _Continuous Delivery_.

This article describes the flow process (which implements the concepts above) starting the moment we merge a commit into master, by the time the package is published to npm with deployed Storybook files.

## Terminology

Before we start, we should understand the following TeamCity terms:

- Build Step - a task to be executed (for instance, `npm run build`)
- Build - a process that executes list of build steps
- Build Chain - a process that refers to several build processes as a single pipeline
- Build Configuration - a collection of settings that define the build process
- Composite Build Configuration - a type of build configuration that aggregates results from several build processes which could be executed in parallel
- Project - a collection of build configurations (a project could be contained inside another project)

## Integrating TeamCity with WSR

As we know, Wix has more than one server of TeamCity. That's actually why we have two different TeamCity projects for WSR:

- [wix-style-react](http://tc.dev.wixpress.com/project.html?projectId=Wix_Angular_WixStyleReact&branch_Wix_Angular_WixStyleReact=__all_branches__) - the main project that's associated with the master branch
- [FedInfra WixStyleReac WixStyleReactNew Parallel](http://pullrequest-tc.dev.wixpress.com/project.html?projectId=FedInfra_WixStyleReac_WixStyleReactNew_Parallel&branch_FedInfra_WixStyleReac_WixStyleReactNew_Parallel=4401%2Fmerge) - a project that's associated with the other branches and triggered when creating a pull request

Also, there are a few differences between them, which we'll mention during the article, however both consists of similar build configurations.

The entry **build configuration**, that actually triggers everything, is called [`wix-style-react`](http://tc.dev.wixpress.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=CommonComponent_WixStyleReact) (what a surprise ðŸ˜‰).
Notice that we differentiate between the project (which has an identical name) and the build configuration. Builds of this configuration are started and associated with new commits of the branch.

Anyway, this build configuration depends on another **composite** build configuration - which is [`wix-style-react-tests-composite`](http://tc.dev.wixpress.com/viewType.html?buildTypeId=Wix_Angular_WixStyleReact_WixStyleReactTests_WixStyleReactTestsComposite). In case you're curious, the dependency is defined by the following rules:

- Do not run new entry build if there is a suitable composite one
- Only use successful builds from suitable composite ones
- On failed composite dependency: make entry build failed to start
- On failed to start/canceled composite dependency: make entry build failed to start

Here's a diagram that demonstrates the dependency:

The next thing we're going to do is understanding how `wix-style-react-tests-composite` works under the hood.
